# oligopeptide-learn
Using SciKit-learn to predict properties of oligopeptides.

This is just a toy example for now, to explore different classifiers in SciKit-learn.

It is based on a dataset of 7 residue peptides which are either all H or all E, according 
to http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/files/ss.txt  Thus, we have a binary classification problem.
